"Honestly, I'm not sure how much I'd trust Morgan Stanley's analysis considering what parts CNBC left out [which you can read here.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/waymo-valuation-cut-google-stock-down-autonomous-vehicles/)

> Tesla, Waymo Projected To Lead In Autonomous Vehicles

> The Morgan Stanley analyst said he expects Tesla Motors (TSLA) and Waymo to be market leaders in autonomous vehicles in 2030. **He expects Tesla to have 26% share, with Waymo next at 18%.**

> **General Motors (GM) would be third in market share, at 13%, with Uber Technologies (UBER) ranked No. 4 at 6%, according to Novak's market forecast.**

How the hell are they coming up with these market share estimate numbers when none of those companies have a fully self driving Level 4 or 5 car on the road today?!? For all they know any of them could flop horribly and never make it to that point. They can make guesses as to who will make it to the market first and for how long until their competitors enter it, but given how much is unknown, and how much the companies keep secret about their progress, it's a fools errand to make any reliable estimates on this, let alone to figure out market share in 2030 from it."
"In the article it says: In terms of Alphabet’s current value, Morgan Stanley has a price target of $1,450, which implies a market cap of about $1 trillion. **That assessment values Waymo at about $20** **billion**, “given industry uncertainty and investors’ lower willingness to pay for cash-burning entities.”


Uhh so which is it $105 billion or $20 billion?"
"Did anyone had a doubt this would happen?  Autonomous cars are insanely complicated:

Anyone saying they're almost here is pushing a corporate agenda."
It’s mind-boggling to me that there have been no attempts (that I know of) to establish a standard for car-to-car communication  among the industry heavyweights.  Unreal.
"I’m sorry, but why is theirs so much higher than Tesla, when I’ve read their technology isn’t working as well"
Lol. Of course it's taking longer than expected. They're not going to solve self-driving in the next decade.
"Analyst says something completely meaningless, what else is new."
Was never priced in.  So not sure why it matters?
">""Most notably, **we underestimated how long safety drivers are likely to be present within cars** and the timing of the rollout of autonomous rides-sharing services.""

Morgan Stanley was suckered by PR videos and rampant lies by the people at Waymo, Tesla, and Uber. 

For example, this from Waymo CEO May of 2018 (two months after the Uber killing, BTW) : https://youtu.be/ogfYd705cRs?t=5795

and this from 2016: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/686279251293777920?lang=en

PR videos and CEO bravado are no substitute for due diligence by Morgan Stanley."
Honestly google is pretty shit at anything outside of Search and Cloud
"You have to take into account the margin of error they are working with, which is 100%. I'm estimating as well, it may be very well higher than that."
">How the hell are they coming up with these market share estimate numbers

There's no product or market. 

They don't even know if level 5 vehicle will be viable for mass use before 2030. 

It's just big bank BS."
The whole thing is so dumb to try and predict. There are way too many variables to take into account.
"Just realized something else absurd about their numbers, if Waymo is worth $105 billion, but Tesla will have a larger market share then Waymo, that means Tesla is worth **at least** $105 billion according to that analyst. Tesla currently has a $44 billion market cap today.

Given that, according to this Morgan Stanley analyst you should be buying Tesla shares all day long because it's heavily undervalued. Ok, so what's Morgan Stanley's rating on Tesla? Well it turns out [Morgan Stanley recently cut their Tesla price target down to $240 a share earlier this year.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-morgan-stanley-adam-jonas-cuts-target-again-2019-4-1028093028)

So I guess that means that Tesla's as yet non-existent level 4/5 self driving car business is worth over $105 billion, and the rest of Tesla has a value at least **negative $60 billion** according to this analyst.

I'm a Tesla long, I think Tesla or Waymo will be the first to the level 4/5 self driving market, but even I think valuing Tesla's current self driving tech at $105 billion is freaking absurd."
guess
"Waymo had level 4 cars in Arizona starting in 2017, and started doing commercial rides in December 2018. 

Waymo One


Uber has had similar level 4 programs in different states. Pretty sure that Uber Volvo which killed the girl on the bike would be level 4."
Because it's economists working with excel spreadsheets trying to predict technology they don't understand at all.
Waymo has level 4 on the road today.
Making predictions ten years out is a fool’s errand.  Seriously.
"We’re entering the world of quantum tech companies, where they can simultaneously be worth $105billion or 0"
It's $0. There's no product that is worth billions of dollars.
G O O G L E
"Where have you read that it isn't working well? Other than the fact that it takes time to develop such a complex product I haven't really heard anything bad, and they are already running services."
"Honestly, the more I think about Waymo, the more I worry they're going to struggle to sell their self driving car tech when they finally get it right. Consider the following:

* Pretty much all the auto-makers are working on self driving cars now, and have been for years. Some are going at it themselves and others are working together, but they're all doing it.

* The ride sharing/taxi businesses of Uber & Lyft are working on it to.

* Even companies who are neither of those things are working on it, like Waymo, Apple, NVIDIA.

So that raises the question, who's going to be buying Waymo's self driving tech when they get it right? All the potential buyers have so much sunken costs at this point that it'll probably make more sense for upper management to just keep spending and get it right, especially if multiple companies achieve level 5 cars within a year of each other (because how hard can it really be at that point if multiple companies can do it?). 

A self driving taxi business is about the only thing I see Waymo being able to do to make money from their self driving cars."
"It’s just what MS thinks, I guess. The free market puts the valuation on TSLA.  So basically what MS thinks is irrelevant, unless google wants to take a loan out against it."
"Where I live, there are LOADS of Waymo cars driving around (like I will see 10 anytime I’m out driving at least). They honestly drive great although I have seen a few times some weird movements or the car stopped on the side of the road, no clue why."
tesla's kills people
people in the industry tend to say google is the furthest along
Google said back in 2015 that it would be on the market by 2020. You calling them a liar!?
"Self-driving, level 4, is already here. I think you mean autonomous level 5.

Level 5 is meaningless and a long way off. It’s not even a real goal."
Arizona is literally the perfect conditions though. How well will those cars do in ice/show in the northeast? How about poor visibility in heavy rain/hurricanes?
"The problem are the small things like a kid coming out of no where and at the moment they are missed by the cars.

Fixing the small things will take the longest."
"Level 4 doesn’t require a driver. Waymo has it, Uber does not."
How about the wheel?
"Simply put, I can buy one competitor's product but not the other. This has been true for about five years now.

It's shocking to see this valuation."
"there could be a major first mover advantage, however. 

consider the regulatory costs of the technology. Every single state (and/or the federal govt eventually) may require approval of the self-driving system. This process could take years of safety/efficacy testing, and we have no idea what standard the government will place on level 5 vehicles."
Waymo is partnered with/has a large stake in Lyft. They already run some of their cars through the service. They don't need to sell the cars to profit from them.
It could become the “android” of autonomous vehicles.
"Yeah, lots of players but little real competition. Uber and Lyft won’t be getting there on their own and will lease/merge/partner with another company. When SDC’s hit the market, if Waymo stays well ahead, auto/rideshare companies will be lined up to partner with or lease from them. Waymo is specifically developing technology to lease."
"Yes auto makers are working on it but I think they will make you buy their self driving cars. 

&#x200B;

But with Waymo you can just set it up on your 2009 Camry and it will just self drive."
There’s still time!
"How do you drive in those conditions? 

Why would you think a neural network wouldn't be able to learn to do the same thing? They have better sensors, more accurate sensors than we do, they react quicker and are more precise than we are. 

Neural networks can already beat us in Chess, Go, Starcraft II, cancer tumor detection, facial recognition. Why would you think humans have some kind of unique ability to being able spot things in heavy rain?"
"I’m sure they suck, that’s why they are level 4."
Uber was also testing its cars in Pittsburgh.
"That kid coming out of no where gets hit by human driven cars too.  I (this isn't directly to you) don't understand why the need for the driverless car to be ""perfect"".  The vast majority of accidents today are caused by driver errors that would be eliminated by even sub optimal driverless technology.   The whole attitude that ""one accident is too much""  when we have thousands of preventable accidents everyday is crazy.  I can't wait for driverless tech to be readily available."
"What I meant it there is no product that Waymo has now.

Of course, there are inventions and product that are worth billions of dollars."
"But what you can buy from Tesla isn't actually an autonomous vehicle, and in either case their endgame isn't just a car to sell commercially to individuals. Both have interest in providing autonomous taxi services, which Waymo actually does right now. And both want to start selling for commercial purposes to companies. If you valued Tesla based on how many cars they sell and how much money they make off of that their market cap would be down ~75%, so why should Waymo be held to that when they clearly have made good progress on their product?"
Actually you raise a really interesting point: there may NOT be a major first mover advantage because they may face so many regulatory hurdles at first that by the time they spend the time and money to clear them their competitors will have caught up with the technology and will also benefit from those hurdles being lifted.
"yeah pretty sure thats not how it will work

no way car companies will allow aftermarket self driving software on their cars"
"Why would I pay well over $5,000 (most likely) to make my 2009 Camry self driving? At that point it would be better to buy a new car.

Also there's a reason why self driving cars are normally EV's. Self driving tech just works way better with EV's because of the power source. There's actually some concerns that a level 5 self driving car will consume a LOT of energy to, because computers, and LiDAR (which are used for most self driving cars) are quite battery hungry."
Yea but it happens a lot know it doesn't even notice it. in cities with a lot of things happening it will take a long time. driving from a to b on a high way is a lot easier.
It is absurd to value Waymo above Tesla. I would place a sizable amount of money on nearly any bet you can describe that pits the two against one another.
What makes you think that?
"There are plenty of advantages Waymo has over Tesla. Waymo is backed by Alphabet's massive cash pile and cash flow to support R&D, while Tesla is backed by junk bond rated debt and shareholder dilution. Waymo is already running autonomous car services, while Tesla is just using the idea to prop up their stock price. 

I'm not going to pretend that Tesla doesn't have its own advantages over Waymo in their pursuit of autonomous cars, but I don't think there is a good reason to say Waymo isn't at least comparable to Tesla when your argument is that Tesla is running an unprofitable car company."

" [https://github.com/commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot)  its already happening.

&#x200B;

also, someone could set up a franchise shop where they outfit it, and back it with some warranty/liability. Not crazy to think"
"no trusted insurance company is going to insurance a car that is running on some opensource, aftermarket software that isn't mainstream and trusted

Insurance companies and the government (for laws) are already having a hard time figuring out the all optics of self driving and how to policy them. No way they will take the risk with third party self driving software which is not take any blame for any problems with their software

-- Work for Insurance company"
"i didnt speak for the opensource. that is hella sketch

google could roll their own insurance... Just like tesla plans to when it goes level 5. No offense to you, but id love to see cheap as shit insurance provided by google/tesla."
"that Tesla insurance is backed by another insurance company 
([State National](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/revealed-the-insurance-giant-partnering-with-tesla-166213.aspx) i think) and if tesla starts paying out alot of claims they are gonna go bankrupt they  are already burning cash and with the potential of paying out claims they will surely go kaput. BTW Tesla are one of the most expensive cars to insurance


to quote Buffet

“It’s not an easy business,” Buffett told shareholders at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. “The success of the auto companies getting into the insurance business is probably as likely as the success of the insurance companies getting into the auto business.”"
